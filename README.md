EQ Maps Rendered in HTML5

Uses PHP and HTML5 to more dynamically build EQ Maps into a page view.

You will want your maps in /maps. It will have the EQ repeated map background in /images.

You can view a working example on https://eqresource.com/test/maptesting.php

TODO: Change maps to choose how to load from likely a GET or POST or make some kind of list to pick, that uses one of these methods

TODO: Add stuff to render in what is on layers 1-3 -- This might or might not happen, 
looping through 6 times instead of 2 might be excessive when you can just manual combine all the 3 map pieces to 1 file instead

TODO: Maybe add Z layer and allow min/max heights to display (if possible)

TODO: See about Text overlapping (though maybe only solution is to make less text in the labels)
